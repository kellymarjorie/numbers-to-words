# numbers to words

A working web application using C#.

This application is a simple form with requires two inputs - a name and a number. It will then display the name and the number, with the number converted from integers to a string, with consideration for decimal points.

This was built using ASP.net MVC5, with HTML5, CSS3, and bootstrap 4.

As part of this work, I made some assumptions which in a real life situation I would've consulted the client: that there wouldn't be any negative numbers, there would only be numbers with two decimal places, that there is no limit on the character length for the name field.
